# Various tests for static-column support in Scylla.

# Test what happens when we SELECT a partition which has a static column
# set but no clustering row, but the static column is *not* selected.
# Reproduces issue #10091.

# Marking this issue "xfail" because Scylla and Cassandra differ in behavior
# and we have no good explanation why Scylla's behavior is more correct than
# Cassandra. If we later decide that we consider *both* behaviors equally
# correct, we can change the test to accept both and make it pass.

    # Insert just the static column, and no clustering row:
    cql.execute(f'INSERT INTO {table1} (p, s) values ({p}, 1)')
    # If we select all the columns, including the static column s, SELECTing
    # the partition gives us one "row" with the static column set and all
    # other columns set to null - otherwise the static column cannot be
    # returned.
    assert list(cql.execute(f'SELECT * FROM {table1} WHERE p={p}')) == [(p,None,1,None)]
    # But what happens if we SELECT just regular (non-static) columns?
    # Should the SELECT return nothing (since there is no clustering row),
    # or return one "row" with null columns (basically just like in the
    # previous SELECT, just intersected with the desired column)?
    # Currently, Cassandra does the former, Scylla does the latter,
    # so the following assert fails on Scylla:
    assert not list(cql.execute(f'SELECT r FROM {table1} WHERE p={p}'))

# Verify that if a partition has a static column set, reading an *existing*
# clustering row will return it, but reading a *non-existing* row will not
# return anything - not even the static column. 
#
# Contrast this with issue #10081 (test_lwt.py::test_lwt_missing_row_with_static)
# where we suggested that in an UPDATE with IF condition (LWT), the static
# columns should be readable in the condition expression, whether or not the
# given row exists.

    # If we SELECT row c=2, we get it and the static column:
