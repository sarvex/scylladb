# setup which an invididual test requires to run; The fixture has setup code
# and teardown code, and if multiple tests require the same fixture, it can
# be set up only once - while still allowing the user to run individual tests
# and automatically setting up the fixtures they need.

# Older versions of the Cassandra driver had a bug where if Scylla returns
